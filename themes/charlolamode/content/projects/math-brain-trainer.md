title: Game for School
dateMonthYear: 2023
description:  Jumping game like Mario or Celeste.  Me and my buddy Ayden made it for a semester project in class.  Not super finished because we didn't get a ton of time to work on top of the fact that I had never used Unity.  Explosion animations took like 10 hours of troubleshooting by themselves.  Ayden and I made all the assets, so it doesn't look great.  Especially since we made them quite quickly.
